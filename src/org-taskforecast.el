;;;; Utility

;;; Debug

(defvar org-taskforecast-enable-assert nil
  "When non-nil, enable `org-taskforecast-assert'.")

(defmacro org-taskforecast-assert (expr &optional message)
  "Assert EXPR.
When EXPR returns nil call error with MESSAGE.
If `org-taskforecast-enable-assert' is nil, this assertion is disabled."
  `(when org-taskforecast-enable-assert
     (unless ,expr
       (error ,(or message
                   (format "Assertion failed: %s" expr))))))

;;; Alist Utility

(defmacro org-taskforecast-defalist (name fields &optional docstring)
  "Define an alist type.
NAME is a name of the alist.
FIELDS is a list of symbols.
DOCSTRING is a documentation of defining alist.

This macro defines following functions:
- Constructor named as NAME
- Type checker named as NAME-type-p

The constructor is defined like below:

    (org-taskforecast-defalist my-abc (a b c))

    Expands to

    (cl-defun my-abc (&key a b c)
      (list (cons 'a a)
            (cons 'b b)
            (cons 'c c)))

To use the constructor like below:

    (my-abc :a 1 :b 2 :c 3)
    => ((a . 1)
        (b . 2)
        (c . 3))

The type checker returns non-nil when the argument is a valid as
the defined alist.
It checks below:
- the argument is an alist
- all of keys of the alist are in FIELDS
- the alist contains all of keys in FIELDS"
  (declare (indent 2) (doc-string 3))
  `(progn
     (defun ,(intern (format "%s-type-p" name)) (x)
       ,(format "Check an alist is valid as `%s'.
Non-nil means valid." name)
       (and (listp x)
            ,@(--map `(assoc ',it x) fields)
            t))

     (cl-defun ,name (&key ,@fields)
       ,(apply #'concat
               `("Make an alist that contains following fields:"
                 ,@(--map (format "\n- %s" it) fields)
                 "\n\n----\n\n"
                 ,docstring))
       (list ,@(--map `(cons ',it ,it) fields)))))
